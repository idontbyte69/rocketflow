## Project Status

- âœ… Client: Next.js application with modern React and TailwindCSS
- ðŸš§ Server: Backend development in progress

## Available Scripts

### Client Scripts

- `npm run build`: Build the application for production
- `npm start`: Start the production server
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint for code quality checks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: If port 3000 is already in use, Next.js will automatically use the next available port.
2. **Node version compatibility**: Ensure you're using Node.js 18.0.0 or higher for optimal compatibility.
3. **Clear cache**: If you encounter build issues, try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again.

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
